Clan Only Plugins
-----------------

These are the scripts that I have made but I felt I did not want to release to the public. Either they are not coded very well, they were requests made by clannies or something that I felt was to useful to share with others outside of the clan.

AutoPractice - Work in progress - A script that will allow you to auto practice desires skills and spells instead of having to manually look each one up.
Level Guide - A level guide script that Gofer and I made. Shows some useful places to level in various level ranges. 
MarketSearch - Work in progress - Gives the user an easy way to search the market place.
PartroxisMazeMobList - Gives the user the ability to search up mobs from the Partroxis Maze and return the room number in which the mob is found.
QuitCheck - Work in progress - I think it gives the user the ability to quit and automatically have the nosave stuff moved to a container or bag.
SOH_IMM - Gives the user the ability to search up IMM mobs and be given their secret keyword to be able to hunt the mob down faster.
WindsExtras - Gives the user some useful aliaes to use while doing winds runs as well as a script similar to the Aarcheology checklist type script that is floating around but for winds cards.
