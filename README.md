Clan Only Plugins
-----------------
<pre>
These are the scripts that I have made but I felt I did not want to release to the public. Either they are
not coded very well, they were requests made by clannies or something that I felt was to useful to share
with others outside of the clan.

<b>AutoPractice</b> - <i>Work in progress</i> - A script that will allow you to auto practice desires skills and
                      spells instead of having to manually look each one up.
<b>Level Guide</b> - A level guide script that Gofer and I made. Shows some useful places to level in various
                     level ranges. 
<b>MarketSearch</b> - <i>Work in progress</i> - Gives the user an easy way to search the market place.
<b>PartroxisMazeMobList</b> - Gives the user the ability to search up mobs from the Partroxis Maze and return
                              the room number in which the mob is found.
<b>QuitCheck</b> - <i>Work in progress</i> - I think it gives the user the ability to quit and automatically
                   have the nosave stuff moved to a container or bag.
<b>SOH_IMM</b> - Gives the user the ability to search up IMM mobs and be given their secret keyword to be able to
          hunt the mob down faster.
<b>WindsExtras</b> - Gives the user some useful aliaes to use while doing winds runs as well as a script similar
                     to the Aarcheology checklist type script that is floating around but for winds cards.
